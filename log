- Got original code to work
- Adjusted code to work with multiple input/output
- Adjusted code to be class-based
- Made TicTacToe game
	- Fixed bug in win recognition
- Made trainer
- Made play
- Tried to train with individual game data sets, then large data sets of all games so far
- Found bug with how the games are recorded for training
- Issues with the NN falling into an equilibrium (spitting out same game reuslt each time, following bad moves anyways because moves chosen during losses were not penalized enough)
- originally the penalty move was e^something and the remainder (1-penaltyscore) would be split between the other available moves, but this would lead to the penalty score being bigger than the others anyways, and so it would repeat the same move
